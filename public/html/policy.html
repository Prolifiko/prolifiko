        <p> We have created this policy to explain why we collect particular information and how we will protect your personal privacy when using the Prolifiko app. </p>


        <h4>Background</h4>
	        <p>Prolifiko collects no more data about you than most other apps. We use the information we have collected about you for the purpose you supplied, for example to send you email reminders on your blogging goals. We also use information to help us understand how the website is being used in order to improve it or to design new services. </p>
	        <p>Under the Data Protection Act, you may at any time request a copy of the information we hold on you by writing to us (see <strong>contact details</strong> below).</p>
	        <p>This privacy policy will be reviewed, and may be revised, from time to time. It was last updated on 18 July 2015. You may wish to revisit it regularly.</p>

        <h4>Email</h4>
          <p>To access the app you need to register with a valid email address. We will not share your contact information with any third party without your consent, see <strong>Data release policy</strong> below.</p>
          <p>By giving us your email address, you agree to allow us to send email messages to that address in order to deliver our services to you. In practice, this will be the reminders you set yourself, occasional emails tailored to your usage, emails about service down-time, or important changes to services. </p>
          <p>In addition, we will also occasionally use the email to contact you for our own purposes, for example to tell you about new services we are offering. We will only do so sparingly. We understand how annoying it can be to receive large quantities of unsolicited mail and we will do our best to ensure that anything we send to you will be relevant and unobtrusive.</p>
          <p>If you have opted out from receiving email, your notifications and reminders can be viewed within the app. </p>



        <h4>Unsubscribe to opt out</h4>
          <p>All emails sent to you will feature an unsubscribe link where you can easily opt of out all email communications. By opting out you will no longer receive any email communication, including important service updates and notifications.</p>

        <h4>Internet Protocol (IP) address and other information</h4>
          <p>As you use the app we collect certain anonymous information not linked to your email or profile. For example, might collect an IP address, domain names, browser type and access times. These will be used to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the app and its services. </p>
          <p>Cookies and may be used to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit. We use cookies to enhance your experience and enable you to use certain features. </p>



        <h4>No selling of information</h4>
          <p>We will not sell personal information collected via this app, such as your email address, to third parties.</p>

        <h4>Demographic information</h4>
          <p>We do not gather demographic data on the website. However, from time to time we might ask for feedback on your use of the app to help us improve the service. Giving feedback is optional and you will be directed to a secure third party website to answer questions. </p>
          <p>We will always tell you why we are gathering feedback and how that information will be used, for example for us to better understand who our users are and how they use the app – this might involve asking about demographic information such as age or gender. This data may be shared with other third parties on an aggregated basis. We may also maintain a database of usage of the website and use this information in aggregate form to track the success of the website. </p>

        <h4>Security</h4>
          <p> Prolifiko has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. However, we make no guarantee that the information that you provide will be secure. </p>

        <h4>Data release policy</h4>
          <p> Our policy is only to release the data we collect in the following circumstances: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>As required by law, such as in response to a valid request from law enforcement.</li>
            <li>To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.</li>
            <li>When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.</li>
            <li>For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user’s Internet Service Provider.</li>
            <li>If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.</li>
            <li>When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of this app.</li>
          </ul>
